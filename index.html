            <h3>Why Holbox?</h3>
            <h2>Holbox</h2>
            <p>
              Isla Holbox (pronounced ol-bosh and Mayan for “black hole”) is a
              long finger of car-free land, tracing a long stretch of sandy
              coastline along the northeastern corner of the Yucatán Peninsula,
              which offers miles upon of untouched beach to discover. The
              peninsula is rich with cenotes (water-filled sinkholes), and Isla
              Holbox is no exception. The best known is the Yalahau Cenote, set
              on the other side of the lagoon. It’s only accessible by boat, but
              it’s a lovely large natural pool with fresh spring water,
              legendary for its rejuvenating powers. Most come for the laid-back
              beach life, others for the spectacular wildlife – the whole area
              is within the Yum Balam nature reserve. You can snorkel with whale
              sharks in the right season (May to September) and see the pink
              flamingos in Punta Mosquito, a new band of sand just over an
              hour’s walk from the edge of town. Thanks to the northwest
              position of the main beach at Isla Holbox, there are numerous
              spots to soak up the beautiful sunsets of the region. Punta Coco
              is a trendy place to enjoy, with a dreamy mix of unspoiled golden
              sands, swaying palms and uninterrupted views out to the horizon.
              One of the most fascinating natural phenomena in Isla Holbox is
              its bioluminescence. The warmer months between May and September
              are the best time of the year to experience the event when the
              waters are most plankton-rich.To appreciate the experience, get in
              the water and splash to stimulate the luminescence.
